# PROJECT: CYBERTRACE - A New Way to Track Cyberattacks

***This project was a proof-of-concept demo'ed in 2021. This is archived for historical purposes. Future development of this will not happen on this repository.***

**CyberTrace** is a framework for tracking, tracing, classifying, and analyzing cyberattacks using advanced detection algorithms based on analysis of live attack fingerprints. CyberTrace comes in two primary parts:

1. The **front-end CyberTrace web application** serves a geographic UI and visualizes live attacks and their origins, as well as communicating possible attack classifications, threat actor histories, possible APTs, and more.

2. The **back-end CyberTrace daemon** is a highly modular framework that monitors log files, network activity, and system activity to detect and classify cyberattacks based on fingerprints using detection algorithms defined in framework modules.
